## Creating your own modules

See [https://gitlab.com/relaxeaza/twoverflow/wikis/Custom-modules](https://gitlab.com/relaxeaza/twoverflow/wikis/Custom-modules)

## Compiling from source

You'll need to install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to build the script from source.

Open the terminal, clone and install the dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/relaxeaza/twoverflow.git
cd twoverflow
npm install
```

Install grunt globally.

```bash
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

To compile run `grunt build`. The script will be compiled inside `dist/`

### Compile flags

You can use some flags to customize the resulting file.

- `--minify` to generate a minified file.
- `--ignore` to ignore specific modules by ID (check _module.json_ for ID).

Example: `grunt build --ignore=farm,minimap --minify` ignores both modules farm and minimap and will generate an minified file.
